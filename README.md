# Ruby Practice Scripts

This repository is a collection of Ruby scripts that I made to practice and learn the Ruby programming language.
If anyone is interested in using these or just running them for fun, here they are.

## Getting Started

To get started with these scripts:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CAWittMN/ruby_practice.git
   ```

   Or using GitHub CLI:

   ```bash
   gh repo clone CAWittMN/ruby_practice
   ```

2. Navigate to the repositories directory:

   ```bash
   cd ruby_practice
   ```

3. Run any of the Ruby scripts with the following command:

```bash
ruby <file-name>.rb
```

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Ruby installed on your machine. You can check if Ruby is installed by running:

```bash
ruby -v
```

If Ruby is not installed, follow the instructions [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) to install it.

## Contributions

Contribute if you'd like, even if that's kind of weird for this kind of repository!

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add new feature`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Create a new Pull Request.
